A lot of projects from this group use Xilinx's System Generator tool for
hardware description. It sits between Vivado and MATLAB, inheriting the
dependencies and system requirements of both.

On my Ubuntu 20.04 box, after hours of installing Vivado 2020.1 and MATLAB
R2020a, System Generator would refuse to open any designs.

> [Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqQQF3CG-5k) to a relaxing Bob Ross video, just in case you're in the same situation.

## Symptoms

Clicking to open any model would crash and show this error in the MATLAB command
window:

![Caught "std::exception" Exception message is: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhogweed.so.5: undefined symbol: __gmpn_cnd_sub_n: Success: Success](/assets/2021-01-28-sysgen-on-20-04/matlab_error.png)

I managed to get it working, so want to make this post for two reasons.

  * Document _what_ the fix is --- helping other frustrated FPGA folks in the
    short term
  * Show _how_ I debugged it --- teaching you to fish (for solutions to EDA tool
    Linux incompatibilities)

## TL;DR

Vivado brings a conflicting version of `libgmp` into your environment.
You can avoid this by moving them to a different folder.

```console
sdr@strath$ cd $XILINX_VIVADO/lib/lnx64.o/Ubuntu/
sdr@strath$ mkdir exclude
sdr@strath$ mv libgmp.so* exclude/
```

You'll also need to install `qt4` from a PPA (the official repos only have qt5
now).

```console
sdr@strath$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rock-core/qt4
sdr@strath$ sudo apt update
sdr@strath$ sudo apt install libqtcore4 libqtgui4
```

That's all. Hopefully you can use System Generator now!

## The Debugging Process

This type of issue will often end in one of two ways:

  * you'll find an arcane incantation online to solve it blindly, or...
  
  * you'll be stuck with the vendor response "Ubuntu 20.04 is not an officially
supported OS. (Please spend a full day reinstalling *everything*)".

I need to use these tools for my own research but don't want that to dictate
which OS I use. These sorts of issues will occasionally crop up if you're as
technologically stubborn as me. So how do we go about debugging something like
this?

Let's try to translate the error message:

> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhogweed.so.5: undefined symbol: __gmpn_cnd_sub_n: Success: Success

It's saying that while running some code in the `libhogweed` library, it
couldn't find a function `__gmpn_cnd_sub_n`. That function is most likely from a
different library. Either this second library can't be found, or maybe it is
pointing to an unexpected version of the library without this function. The
later is a common issue with EDA tools because vendors like to package their
software up with lots of older libraries that they control, rather than the more
typical Linux approach of using system libraries controlled by the package
manager. We'll often get into a situation where a system library has a
dependency that is satisfied by the package manager but the EDA tool has kindly
injected an older version of it into our environment. If the two versions are
incompatible, we have a problem.

We can use `ldd` to show us the library dependencies a program has. This will
show us if any dependencies are missing, or if any are being found in an unusual
place. From inside MATLAB (this is important --- if you open a new terminal your
environment might not be the same) let's ask about `libhogweed`'s dependencies.


```console
>> !ldd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhogweed.so.5
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcfbae1000)
	libnettle.so.7 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnettle.so.7 (0x00007f4770bce000)
	libgmp.so.10 => /home/craig/tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2020.1/lib/lnx64.o/Ubuntu/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007f4770941000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f477074f000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4770c64000)
```

This is showing us that all but one library is from the system `/lib/` folder.
The odd one out is `libgmp` which is being sourced from Vivado's own stash of
libraries. So, our system version of `libhogweed` is trying to call a function
from `libgmp`, but it's not pointing to the correct version and it fails to find
the function.

The easiest way to ignore one of these libraries bundled with Vivado is to move
it into a different folder. This removes it from our library path but keeps it
around on disk in case we need to restore it.

```console
sdr@strath$ cd $XILINX_VIVADO/lib/lnx64.o/Ubuntu/
sdr@strath$ mkdir exclude
sdr@strath$ mv libgmp.so* exclude/
```

Obviously there might be other consequences for hiding this library from Vivado,
but we can always restore it after doing our System Generator work.

Now our original error should disappear but things still aren't quite right.
After trying to load a model MATLAB will have a long hard think to itself before
opening Simulink and reporting this warning:


```console
Warning: The System Generator GUI socket server timedout while waiting for an incoming socket connection. To tune the acceptTimeout value in the xlServerSocketOptions.m file. The xlServerSocketOptions.m file is on your MATLAB path and can be edited by typing 'edit xlServerSocketOptions.m' in the MATLAB console.
```

Although Simulink has opened, strange things will happen when interacting with
anything System Generator specific. For example, let's just try to double click
a simple block and change it's properties.

Hmm. From a bit of googling, this is sounds like the default behaviour when
System Generator has simply not started up but we make it into Simulink
regardless. The warning hints at this as well. Let's try to find out _why_
sysgen hasn't started up.

We'll try to find out where the `sysgen` program lives with the `which` command.

```console
sdr@strath$ which sysgen
/home/craig/tools/Xilinx//Vivado/2020.1/bin/sysgen
```

The next step would be to use `ldd` to check for missing dependencies. However,
this `sysgen` file isn't actually a binary program so `ldd` will fail. The file
is actually just a huge bash script that sources various things and sets up our
environment before launching the real, honest to goodness binary.

So where's the real binary? Let's use `find` and assume it is 1) a file, 2) an
_executable_ file, and 3) has "sysgen" somewhere in its name.

```console
sdr@strath$ cd $XILINX_VIVADO
sdr@strath$ find . -executable -type f -name '*sysgen*'
./examples/sysgen_demos/sysgenFSE_PreLoadFcn.m
./bin/unwrapped/lnx64.o/sysgensockgui
./bin/sysgen
...
```

I've omitted a few entries here, but the one we're looking for appears to be
`./bin/unwrapped/lnx64.o/sysgensockgui`. Apart from the bash script, this is the
only match in the `bin/` folder.

Let's check it with `ldd`.

```console
sdr@strath$ ldd ./bin/unwrapped/lnx64.o/sysgensockgui
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff435fe000)
	libQtCore.so.4 => not found
	libQtGui.so.4 => not found
	libQtNetwork.so.4 => not found
	libQtXml.so.4 => not found
	librdi_itlib.so => not found
	libstdc++.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fec76fb5000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007fec76e64000)
	libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fec76e49000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fec76c57000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fec771ba000)
```

A ha! It's missing some qt4 libraries! This is a bit awkward because Ubuntu
20.04 only has qt5 in its official repos. If you're comfortable using PPAs that
random blogs suggest, go ahead and install qt4 like so:


```console
sdr@strath$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rock-core/qt4
sdr@strath$ sudo apt update
sdr@strath$ sudo apt install libqtcore4 libqtgui4
```

And that's us! System generator seems to run OK now, and we've met some tools to
help us fix similar issues the next time you upgrade OS.
